<h1>Another Year of Superhero Movies</h1>
<p>2017 is just another year for superhero movies as they continue to progress in there respecting movie universes.</p>

<p>We already know some actors will not be coming back to play famous characters like, Hugh Jackman no longer being Wolverine or how Robert Downy Jr. will no longer be Iron Man.  But even if those actors fall new heroes are taking over.  Good example is <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> who has been portrayed by two actors on the big screen and a third on its way. </p>
